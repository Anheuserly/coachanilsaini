        <h1>[English] 1x5x30 100% Relax - Nervous System - Change Your Life</h1>

        <p>Good morning, today's video is a very short video, so do not skip because if you watch the video, your life is going to be transformed.</p>

        <p>I am showing you something—see this, I am showing you a pendulum, and you should pay attention to the amplitude of this pendulum.</p>

        <h2>What is Dimension?</h2>
        <p>We call it a dimension. Now, why am I showing you this? You must have seen this many times before. Yes, friends, today's video depends on the dimension of this pendulum. It shows how your life can be transformed.</p>

        <h2>Reprogramming Your Subconscious Mind</h2>
        <p>See, your subconscious mind is your habit, and your habit is your subconscious mind. If you want to change the world, are you ready to change yourself? Yes, friends, if you want to change the world, first change yourself. The world will change automatically, but it's not easy to change yourself.</p>

        <p>Reprogramming your subconscious mind is not easy. But I am going to tell you an easy technique. It is a very easy technique, and your subconscious mind can change in a jiffy.</p>

        <h3>The Technique</h3>
        <p>Here’s the technique: Sit straight—whether you are sitting on a bed, the ground, or a chair, make sure you are at a 90° angle. Keep your waist straight.</p>

        <p>Once your waist is straight, focus on your breathing. You have to inhale and exhale, but with increased duration than your normal breath. This means while inhaling and exhaling, you need to focus on the pendulum's amplitude, that is, the duration of your breath.</p>

        <p>As you inhale and exhale, focus your mind 100% on your breath going in and out. You have to do this for only 5 minutes. Yes, only 5 minutes a day.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>1 * 5 * 30 = 100% Relax</p>
            <p>Do this technique for 5 minutes daily for 30 days, and after 30 days, you'll be thanking me. See you in the next video, and if possible, subscribe to my channel: Coach Anil Saini. Thank you!</p>
