            <h1>[English] How to Quit Bad Habits and Overcome Illness Without Medication</h1>
    
            <p>Good morning and great morning friends, today I have brought a very good video for you. This video will bring tremendous change in your life, will create a new energy in your life, and I am 100% sure that the trigger of your life is going to be on. So friends, I will start my video without any delay for you.</p>
    
            <h2>How to Listen to This Video</h2>
            <p>If possible, you can listen to this video by going to a secluded place or wearing your earphones. Then do this technique directly in your subconscious. If it is night, then you can listen to it while sleeping. Even if you listen to it before, this technique is going to go directly into your subconscious mind. What you have to do is listen to it while sleeping and as soon as you wake up in the morning, you have to listen to this video first. Then you will feel that in 21 days there will be a change in your life. Where did this change come from, why did it come, you will not even know. You will have to work effortlessly.</p>
    
            <h2>The Power of Your Mind</h2>
            <p>Being alert or aware of your thoughts is the best meditation. Do you know that there are 80 lakh neurons in our mind and about 40 lakh neurons in the heart? Apart from this, there are 60 trillion cells in our body which control our body, and on those 60 trillion cells, there are millions of antennae which work as receiver and receptor.</p>
    
            <h2>How Thoughts Affect Us</h2>
            <p>Whenever any thought arises in our mind, it first goes to our subconscious mind. As soon as that thought goes to the subconscious mind, it starts analyzing that thought. Within a few seconds, 80 lakh neurons share that information among themselves, completing what we call the neurocity circuit.</p>
    
            <h2>The Chemical Reaction</h2>
            <p>Once this circuit is completed, our subconsciousness releases four hormones: dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, and oxytocin. These chemicals make us feel good, regardless of whether the thoughts were negative or positive.</p>
    
            <h2>Breaking Bad Habits</h2>
            <p>Gradually, we can become addicted to certain habits, whether they're good or bad. To break bad habits, I'm going to tell you about a powerful technique called NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming).</p>
    
            <h3>The NLP Technique</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Acknowledge your addiction or bad habit to your family members.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the side effects or cravings in your body.</li>
                <li>Give a signal to the 80 lakh neurons in your mind that you've left this habit.</li>
                <li>Understand that it takes 60 days to change an old habit.</li>
                <li>Keep your mind in alert mode to control which thoughts enter your subconscious.</li>
                <li>Replace bad habits with good ones.</li>
            </ol>
    
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Remember, it takes 66 days to fully change a habit. In the first 20 days, the seed germinates. In the next 22 days, you'll see the leaves of change. In the last 20 days, your mind starts releasing the same pleasurable chemicals for your new, healthy habits.</p>
            </div>
    
            <p>Friends, I have told you this technique. You can use it to get rid of bad habits or even overcome diseases in your body (except for accidental cases). In the next video, I will show you the Six PIPC (Preinstalled Cycle) Technique, which is very powerful for achieving success in anything.</p>
